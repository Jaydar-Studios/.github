Jaydar studios is ~~just me making a "company" out of myself~~ my ~~not at all~~ totally legit game company.

Here, we make only ~~the stupidest crap~~ the best games ever with ~~1,000,000~~ 0 bugs or glitches, and the ~~most spaghetti~~ cleanest code you'll ever see!

This GitHub profile may not have much, but there's tons of stuff we've ~~uploaded to the internet~~ published to Steam.

Anyways, I've gotta go ~~make myself some Hot Pockets~~ run to an important business meeting, so bye!

 -The founder, co-founder, CEO, general superviser, general manager, and only employee of JAYDAR STUDIOS, Jaydar.
